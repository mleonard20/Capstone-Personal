Capstone

During my senior year fall semester at Merrimack College I took my Data Science Capstone Class. I worked in a group with 2 other class mates and we worked with a Heart Disease Classification Dataset. We used multiple Machine Learning methods to predict whether or not the target variable had heart disease.
